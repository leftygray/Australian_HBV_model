## HBV Estimates and Projections Model ##

This project involves the development of an epidemiological model of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission in Australia. The primary purpose of the model is to provide estimates for the prevalence, incidence, and disease burden of HBV in Australia nationally, by each state and territory, and by local health district (LHD) for NSW and project future epidemic trajectories for each region. 
The project involves the collaboration between the Kirby Institute, UNSW Australia, and the Cowie group at the Epidemiology Unit VIDRL, The Doherty Institute, Victoria. NSW Health provided funding as part of the [_BBV & STI Research, Intervention and Strategic Evaluation Program (BRISE)_](http://www.brise.com.au/). While the model has been primarily developed to estimate the number of people living with chronic HBV and assocaited disease burden, the code has been designed to be as flexible as possible to faciliate future model development and applications. 

The HBV model is based on a previous model implemented in [_Berkeley Madonna_](http://www.berkeleymadonna.com/) and has been published previously (MacLachlan et. al. The Burden of Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection in Australia. Aust NZ J Public Health 37; 5: 416â€“22. doi:10.1111/1753-6405.12049). The current model is written in the R language as scripts or R markdown files and is currently **under development**.
